# Hi, this is Daniel
Nice to have you around here.

I'm mainly using this repo to host some [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)  presentations.
Hakim made a great tool -- try it!

I am also translating some games by the very talented [Nicky Case](https://github.com/ncase).

I am also taking advantage of the [Bootstrap CDN](getbootstrap.com), with [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons.
They make things almost too easy.

You can also navigate my projects via http://db4rr.github.io/

**Have fun! :)**
